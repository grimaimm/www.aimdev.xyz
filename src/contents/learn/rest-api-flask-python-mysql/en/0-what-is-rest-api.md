    So, REST API stands for <b>Representational State Transfer</b>. Basically, it’s a way for apps to talk to each other using HTTP. An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a communication bridge between your app and the server, so we can exchange data. Usually, data is sent in JSON or XML format.

    Why is it called REST? Well, REST has simple rules for communication, like using HTTP methods to do stuff:
  </p>
  <div class="content">
    <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pb-2 pl-10">
      <li><code>GET</code> : to fetch data from the server (like getting a list of users).</li>
      <li><code>POST</code> : to send data to the server (like adding new data).</li>
      <li><code>PUT</code> : to update existing data.</li>
      <li><code>DELETE</code> : to delete data.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    Basically, REST API is simple and easy to understand, and it’s widely used for communication between frontend and backend.
