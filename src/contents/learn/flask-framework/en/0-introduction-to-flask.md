  <p>
    Flask is one of the most popular microframeworks for the Python programming language. It is termed as a "microframework" due to its minimalist core that focuses on the fundamental requirements for building web applications. Flask provides developers with significant freedom to choose and integrate additional components as per the project's specific needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Flask is an excellent choice for developers who seek full control over the structure and components used in their web projects, without the complexities often associated with larger, more opinionated frameworks.

    <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pb-2 pl-10">
      <li><code>Simple and Easy to Learn</code> : Flask is designed to be easily understood, offering a faster learning curve compared to several other web frameworks.</li>
      <li><code>Flexible</code> : Flask does not enforce specific project structures or patterns, allowing developers to select and use components as required by their applications.</li>
      <li><code>Lightweight</code> : With its minimalist core, Flask is suitable for small to medium-scale applications. Despite its lightweight nature, Flask can efficiently handle web applications.</li>
      <li><code>Rapid Prototyping</code> : Due to its simplicity and ease of use, Flask is excellent for quickly prototyping applications.</li>
      <li><code>Wide Extension Ecosystem</code> : Despite its lightweight core, Flask boasts a broad ecosystem with various extensions that can be used to add features like user authentication, database integration, and more.</li>

  <div class="content">
    <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pb-2 pl-10">
      <li><code>Routing</code> : Flask uses the <code>@app.route()</code> decorator to specify which URL triggers a particular function (view function). This makes it easy for developers to define how the application responds to incoming HTTP requests.</li>
      <li><code>Templating</code> : Flask uses Jinja2 as its default template engine, enabling developers to generate dynamic HTML content by inserting variables and logic controls into templates.</li>
      <li><code>Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)</code> : Flask operates based on WSGI, a standardized interface for connecting Python web applications to web servers like Apache or Nginx.</li>
      <li><code>Request-Response Cycle</code> : When a Flask application receives an HTTP request, Flask matches the requested URL with the corresponding function and generates a response that is sent back to the client.</li>
    </ul>
