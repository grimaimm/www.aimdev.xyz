In this article, we'll provide a comprehensive guide to explaining programming,
helping you answer the question, what is programming? We'll also cover the distinctions
between computer programming and coding, define programming languages, explore the benefits of programming,
and offer some useful tips for beginners looking to get started.

> What is Programming?

<div class="space-y-3">
  <p>
    JavaScript is a programming language used in web development to make pages dynamic and interactive. It runs directly in the user's browser without needing compilation, allowing manipulation of HTML and CSS, user interactions, and server communication.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that we've outlined what programming is, let's explore its relevance in the contemporary world. It's safe to say that programming is deeply intertwined with our daily lives in numerous ways, often more than we realize.
  </p>
  <p>
    The utilization of programming to enhance convenience can be observed across various domains, including business, entertainment, transportation, healthcare, agriculture, sports, politics, and beyond.

> What are Programming Languages?

<div class="space-y-3">
<p>
  Programmers communicate instructions to computers through programming languages, which, like human languages such as English and Spanish, have syntax rules guiding the logic behind the code. These languages are typically classified into four distinct categories.
</p>
<ol className="list-decimal space-y-3 pb-2 pl-10">
  <li>
    <p className="font-medium">Machine Language</p>
    <p>
      The saying "computers understand only 1s and 0s" means they use machine code, which is made up of binary digits. Inside a computer, tiny switches called transistors turn on (1) and off (0), letting the CPU create output. Machine code is a basic language that talks directly to the hardware. For instance, here's some machine code for the word 'Hello'.
    </p>
    <p className="font-medium">Machine Code Example:</p>

```bash
01001000  01100101  01101100  01101100  01101111
```

  </li>
  <li>
    <p className="font-medium">Assembly Language (ASM)</p>
    <p>
      This code was created to avoid the hassle of machine code. It uses symbols and characters. Since computers only understand 0s and 1s, assemblers convert it to machine code. Assembly language is still hard to read and needs deep knowledge of computer memory and CPU processes. It's also a low-level language.
    </p>
    <p className="font-medium">Assembly Language Examples:</p>

```bash
org  0x100

mov  dx, msg
mov  ah, 9
int  0x21

mov  ah, 0x4c
int  0x21

msg  db 'Hello', 0x0d, 0x0a, '$'
```

  </li>

  <li>
  <p className="font-medium">Mid-Level Language</p>
  <p>
    When we move away from low-level languages, we encounter high-level languages. However, it's useful to first consider intermediate languages, which make coding easier while still allowing direct hardware control. Examples include C, Pascal, and Cobol. Here's a C code snippet to print 'Hello' to the screen.
  </p>
  <p className="font-medium">Mid-Level Language Examples:</p>

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello");
  return 0;
}
```

  </li>

  <li>
  <p className="font-medium">High-Level Language</p>
  <p>
    When we talk about programming languages, we usually mean high-level ones. Most programmers use these daily. They use compilers to translate code into machine code. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and PHP. Here's a JavaScript example that prints 'Hello' to the console.
  </p>
  <p className="font-medium">High-Level Language Examples:</p>

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The utilization of programming to enhance convenience can be observed across various domains, including business, entertainment, transportation, healthcare, agriculture, sports, politics, and beyond.

> Difference Between Coding & Programming?

<div class="space-y-3">
  <p>
    We often hear the terms 'coding' and 'programming' used interchangeably, but there are several differences to note.
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pb-2 pl-10">
    <li>
      <p className="font-medium">Coding</p>
      <p>
        Is a core element of programming that involves translating the logic of a program so that it can be understood and executed by a computer. It involves writing the lines of code that make up the program, so it focuses more on using the syntax of the programming language to communicate with the computer.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p className="font-medium">Programming</p>
      <p>
        More than just writing code. It usually includes other aspects of software creation, such as identifying program requirements, translating requirements into code, debugging, testing, creating documentation, and more.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The relationship between coding and programming can be compared to writing a novel. Coding is similar to writing the sentences and paragraphs that make up a novel, while programming involves creating broader elements, such as plot, setting, character development, narrative, and so on.
