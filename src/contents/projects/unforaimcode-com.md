    Copy the <strong>unforaimcode.com</strong> repository from GitHub to your
    computer by using the command below in the terminal or command prompt:
  </p>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grimaimm/unforaimcode.com.git
```

</div>

  <h3 class='text-[18px] font-medium leading-snug dark:text-neutral-300'>
    <strong>3. Setup Virtual Environment</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Create a Python virtual environment for this project to isolate its dependencies. Use the following command:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pb-2 pl-10 mt-1">
  <li>
    <p className="font-medium">If you use venv (Python 3.3+):</p>

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

  </li>
  <li>
    <p className="font-medium">Activate virtual environment:</p>

```bash
venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
```

  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class='space-y-3'>
  <h3 class='text-[18px] font-medium leading-snug dark:text-neutral-300'>
    <strong>4. Install Dependencies</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Install all dependencies required by the Flask project. Make sure you are in a virtual environment before running this command:
  </p>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</div>

<div class='space-y-3'>
  <h3 class='text-[18px] font-medium leading-snug dark:text-neutral-300'>
    <strong>5. Run the Flask Application</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Finally, run the Flask application with the command:
  </p>

```bash
python run.py
```

<p>
  Now you can open the browser and access the Flask application via
  <a>http://localhost:5000</a> or the URL displayed in the terminal after
  executing the above command.
