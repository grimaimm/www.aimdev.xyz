## 🚀 Getting Started

If you are interested in running this project on your local machine, you need to follow these steps:

### 1. Clone using git

Copy the **unforaimcode.com** repository from GitHub to your computer by using the command below in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grimaimm/unforaimcode.com.git
```

### 2. Navigate to Project Directory

Open a terminal or command prompt, then go to the project directory you just cloned with the command:

```bash
cd unforaimcode.com
```

### 3. Setup Virtual Environment

Create a Python virtual environment for this project to isolate its dependencies. Use the following command:

- If you use venv (Python 3.3+):
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```
- Activate virtual environment:
  ```bash
  venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows
  source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all dependencies required by the Flask project. Make sure you are in a virtual environment before running this command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Flask Application

Finally, run the Flask application with the command:

```bash
python run.py
```

Now you can open the browser and access the Flask application via http://localhost:5000 or the URL displayed in the terminal after executing the above command.
