    Hello! Thanks for stopping by my personal website.
</p>
<p>
    I'm Aim. I've been working in web development, handling both the coding you see on the screen (frontend) and the stuff that happens behind the scenes (backend). Iâ€™m passionate about creating websites and apps that are not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly.
</p>
<p>
    I specialize in ReactJS, NextJS, and TailwindCSS for building modern, responsive frontends. On the backend, Iâ€™m proficient in Flask and Python, ensuring robust and efficient server-side operations. I love exploring new web tools and technologies, always seeking to enhance the development process and deliver top-notch solutions.
</p>
<p>
    Based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©, Iâ€™m excited about new challenges and continuously growing in the ever-evolving field of web development. Join me on this journey as I share insights and experiences in the world of technology.

<p>
    Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
